There are basically 6 bitwise operators which we need to study.

& ----> bitwise AND {function same as AND gate }
| ----> bitwise OR  {function same as OR gate}
^ ----> bitwise XOR { function same as XOR gate}
>> ---> rightshift operator {it shifts binary bits to right}
ex: 110011 >>1 ===> 011001.
<< ---> leftshift operator {it shifts binary bits to left}
ex: 110011 << 1 ===> 100110.

x>>1 is equivalent to dividing by 2.
x<<1 is equivalent to multiplying by 2.

x>>y is equivalent to dividing by 2^y.
x<<y is equivalent to multiplying by 2^y.

~ ---> this operator is used as not operator or negation operator
