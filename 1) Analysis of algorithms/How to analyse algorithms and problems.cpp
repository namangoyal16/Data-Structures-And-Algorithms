Different programs may produce the same output for a given input, but they can have different time complexities. 
This can depend on system and computer performance, as well as on the actual time each program takes to solve the problem.

big O--upper bound;
theta---exact;
omega---lowerbound;
best is using BIG O notation for explaining time complexitites of the function.

for(int i=1;i<n;i++)  has time complexity of O(n);
for(int i=1;i<n;i=i*2)  has time complexity of O(logn);
for(int i=1;i<n;i=pow(i,c)) has time complexity of O(loglogn);

Analyse time complexities using permutation and combinations which you learnt in class 11.

for complex algorithms :
such as DFS, BFS and merging of two sorted arrays , time complexities depend on two inputs , we will analyse time complexities of such algorithms also.

for recursion write recurrence relations , and then solve them to analyze time complexities of those relations.{master theorem, recurrsive tree approach}
one other way to analyze time complexity of recursion is that , remember : how many times functions called*in each function how many operations are taking place.
make recursive tree for any kind of recursive problem and analyze it thoroughly.

//T(n)=2T(n/2)+C has time complexity of O(n);
//T(n)=2T(n-1)+C has time complexity of O(2^n);
//T(n)=T(n/2)+C has time complexity of O(logn);
//T(N)=T(n/4)+T(n/2)+Cn has time complexity of same as 2T(n/2)+Cn ---consider upper bound only , that is the worst case. therefore,TC==O(n*n)====>becoz, in every function call ,
n operations are taking place.

REMEMBER ONE SIMPLE RULE : ALWAYS THINK OF NO OF OPERATIONS RUNNING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT THE TIME COMPLEXITY.

SPACE COMPLEXITY : AUXILLARY SPACE + INPUT SPACE,
Input space  is the space taken to store the input which is constant and not in our hands.
but still we can optimize input space as we do in adjacency list in graphs.
Auxillary space is the extra space required to calculate the output using the input.
This space is completely in our hands as it depends on us how intelligently we solve our problem without taking any unnecessary extra space.
