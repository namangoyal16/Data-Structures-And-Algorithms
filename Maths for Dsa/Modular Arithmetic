Modualr arithmetic is mathematical technique to deal with remainders.

Always remember that when we divide Dividend/divisor , the Remainder will always be surely less than the divisor and this is the keyconcept for Modular Arithmetic.

A â‰¡ B(mod M) means when A is divide by m it leaves a remainder of b.

There are some rules , which are needed to be remembered for Modular Arithmetic.  // Usually we keep M=1e9+7; 1e9 because it is the range of int and +7 becase it makes it prime which is needed

#Modular addition: 
(A+B) % M =(A % M + B % M) % M.

Modular Multiplication:
(A*B) % M =(A % M * B % M) % M.

Modular Divison:
(A/B) % M = (A * inverse of B if it exists) % M.

#Modular inverse of a number.
